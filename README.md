Introduction:
This project focuses on conducting an in-depth HR analysis to gain valuable insights into employee performance, salary disparity, and overall employee satisfaction within the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry. By analyzing various factors, including gender, department, and years of service, we aim to identify areas of improvement, promote fairness and equality, and enhance employee engagement.

Data Exploration and Preparation:
The project involved the creation of two tables, 'emp_details' and 'emp_performance,' within a PostgreSQL database. These tables were utilized to store employee information, such as age, gender, department, and date of joining, as well as performance metrics like ratings and completion rates. By combining and analyzing these datasets, we extracted meaningful insights.

Employee Demographics and Distribution:
We examined employee demographics and distribution by executing queries to analyze the distribution of employees across different cities and departments. This analysis shed light on the gender composition within departments and provided valuable information on the distribution of employees in various cities.

Compensation and Benefits Analysis:
A crucial aspect of this project involved analyzing salary and compensation data to ensure fairness and equality. By examining pay disparities based on department, job title, and gender, we identified potential areas for improvement. Additionally, we performed a comprehensive analysis of benefits to ensure competitive compensation packages.

Performance Analysis:
To enhance employee performance and engagement, we conducted an in-depth analysis of performance metrics such as ratings, project completion rates, and employee efficiency. This analysis provided insights into departmental performance disparities and identified opportunities for improvement.

Employee Turnover Analysis:
Understanding employee retention and attrition rates is crucial for organizational success. We examined the years of service and identified employees who have been with the organization for more than five years. This analysis helped identify trends in employee turnover and retention, providing valuable insights for future retention strategies.

Key Findings and Insights:
Through our analysis, several important findings emerged:
- Gender disparities were identified in specific departments, highlighting the need for diversity and inclusion efforts.
- Compensation gaps across departments and genders underscored the importance of fair and equitable practices.
- Project completion rates varied significantly across departments, emphasizing the need for performance improvement measures.
- Negative correlations between service period and salary for female employees in certain departments suggested potential systemic issues.
- Productivity disparities in some departments indicated the necessity of reevaluating remote work policies.
- Poor employee retention rates called for initiatives to enhance engagement and satisfaction.

Recommendations and Next Steps:
Armed with these insights, stakeholders can make data-driven decisions to address gender disparities, promote equality, enhance compensation and benefits structures, boost performance, and improve employee retention. Implementing measures such as diversity initiatives, fair compensation practices, and remote work enhancements will contribute to creating a thriving and inclusive work environment.

Conclusion:
This HR analysis project has provided valuable insights into employee performance, salary disparity, and overall employee satisfaction within the FMCG industry. By leveraging data-driven decision-making, we can foster a fair and inclusive workplace that drives organizational success.
